# Optim Corte
### A simple VB.NET implementation of a genetic algorithm to optimize the cutting of rebar
---
Requirements:
 - Desired bar lengths must be defined in a text file "data.in"
 - Desired bars will be cut from 12m and 14m source bars
 - The first `duty` bars will always be cut, while the rest will only be used to reduce excess.
 - Total excess is the figure of merit
